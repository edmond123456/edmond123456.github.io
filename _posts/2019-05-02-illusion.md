# Start from  a typical versual illusion(2020/01/27 update)

Since I am a student who is doing research about thermal illusion based on the existed optical illusion, I am going to describe some optical illusions from today.

I will start my work from a book which is called [新 錯視図鑑: 脳がだまされる奇妙な世界を楽しむ・解き明かす・つくりだす](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E6%96%B0-%E9%8C%AF%E8%A6%96%E5%9B%B3%E9%91%91-%E8%84%B3%E3%81%8C%E3%81%A0%E3%81%BE%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%82%8B%E5%A5%87%E5%A6%99%E3%81%AA%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E3%82%92%E6%A5%BD%E3%81%97%E3%82%80%E3%83%BB%E8%A7%A3%E3%81%8D%E6%98%8E%E3%81%8B%E3%81%99%E3%83%BB%E3%81%A4%E3%81%8F%E3%82%8A%E3%81%A0%E3%81%99-%E6%9D%89%E5%8E%9F-%E5%8E%9A%E5%90%89/dp/4416518994).

Due to limit of my spare time, I may possibily have not enough time to describe all about the illusions. I will introduce those illusions that are related to shape and brightness because these kinds of illusions are almost the most famous ones and can be transfered to some other percepts such as thermal percept. I will introduce them from from 4 basic parts

1. What is illusion?

2. Mechanism of illusion

3. Illusion of shape or size

4. Illusion of brightness


## 1. What is illusion?
(From wikipedia) An optical illusion (also called a visual illusion) is an illusion caused by the visual system and characterized by a visual percept that arguably appears to differ from reality. We human being observe the world, recognize the world through our eyes in our daily life. 70% of the information processed in our brain come from optical information so it is really very important for us tounderstand what we see through the eyes. On the other hand, optical illusions are not rare things for us so we also need to understand the illusions well.

A typical optical illusion may be barber's pole.A spinning barber pole creates a visual illusion, in which the stripes appear to be traveling up or down the length of the pole, rather than around it. This illusion occurs because a bar or contour within a frame of reference provides ambiguous information about its "real" direction of movement. The actual motion of the line has many possibilities. The shape of the aperture thus tends to determine the perceived direction of motion for an otherwise identically moving contour. A vertically elongated aperture makes vertical motion dominant whereas a horizontally elongated aperture makes horizontal motion dominant. In the case of a circular or square aperture, the perceived direction of movement is usually orthogonal to the orientation of the stripes (diagonal, in this case). The perceived direction of movement relates to the termination of the line's end points within the inside border of the occluder. The vertical aperture, for instance, has longer edges at the vertical orientation, creating a larger number of terminators unambiguously moving vertically. This stronger motion signal forces us to perceive vertical motion. Functionally, this mechanism has evolved to ensure that we perceive a moving pattern as a rigid surface moving in one direction.

However, illusions come in a wide variety; their categorization is difficult because the underlying cause is often not clear but a classification proposed by Richard Gregory is useful as an orientation. According to that, there are three main classes: physical, physiological, and cognitive illusions, and in each class there are four kinds: Ambiguities, distortions, paradoxes, and fictions. A classical example for a physical distortion would be the apparent bending of a stick half immerged in water; an example for a physiological paradox is the motion aftereffect (where, despite movement, position remains unchanged). An example for a physiological fiction is an afterimage. Three typical cognitive distortions are the Ponzo, Poggendorff, and Müller-Lyer illusion. Physical illusions are caused by the physical environment, e.g. by the optical properties of water. Physiological illusions arise in the eye or the visual pathway, e.g. from the effects of excessive stimulation of a specific receptor type. Cognitive visual illusions are the result of unconscious inferences and are perhaps those most widely known.

Pathological visual illusions arise from pathological changes in the physiological visual percept mechanisms causing the aforementioned types of illusions; they are discussed e.g. under visual hallucinations.

## 2.Mechanism of illusion
### 2.1 Why does illusion cannot be fixed?
The characteristic of illusion is not only seeing those things that are not fact, even though we human beings are told that 'it's not fact!', it is very difficult to fix according to our sense, illusion still occurs. So here is the question: Why we cannot fix the illusion even though we know the fact?

One possibile reason is that, the optical information that is caught by retina(organization at eyes) is trasnfered to brain and processed at brain. At this time, first, the optical signals are processed in various neurons of narrow areas of retina. Then, the calculated results are transfered to the neurons of comparatively large areas of retina. At last, these information are processed and united at area that performs GLOBAL process.

At the original phase, neurons at a very large scale work independently. They are unconscious process. However, logistic process based on sense belongs to almost the final phase.

On the other hand, at the perception level, the processed results that are performed by the neurons at original phase are also reflected in our perception. In this case, at LOCAL areas of retina, process results like detecting edge of direction are transfered to perception level independentlt. These results are not necessarily united as a whole.

If this is true, those signal processing results are almost results that performed at unconscious phase. As a result, it becomes understandable that even though we are told the fact. This is an understanding of the fact that we cannot fix illusion. In this case, even we feel troubled when we face illusion, we do not need to make any effort to fix it. On the other hand, we have no way but to consider one way to adapt to the illusion.



### 2.2 Main theories of illusion
There are still much things that we do not know about the mechanism of illusion. However, we can still explain part of the illusions. Moreover, even we cannot explain all about some illusion, we can estimate the possible mechanism of some illusion. Here I will introduce main theories about illusions.
#### 2.2.1 Optical illusion created by movement of lines due to smoothing
Here I would like to introduce the theory(Fermuller and Malm,2004) that explains the many illusions of transformated shapes. In this theory, when the figure is caught at retina, due to the limitaion of resolution of retina, error called smoothing occurs. Smoothing is the reason that causes the gap of location of the lines.

Smoothing is an operation that replaces brightness of each point by an average value.
![smoothing-1](https://edmond123456.github.io/img/illusion/1.png) As the figure shows above, edge that devides the black block and white block in D, can be shown as the graph in E. Graph E show the brightness value spatially. It looks like a step. When smoothing is performed, step line in graph E becomes gentle. This process is called smoothing. Notice that, where it was black becomes white, and where it was white becomes black at some areas. However, the location of edge does not change. So we can say that smoothing does not change the location of edge.

![smoothing-2](https://edmond123456.github.io/img/illusion/2.png) As the figure shows above, as shown in A and B, when there is a narrow gray line between the white and black regions, when smoothing is performed, white and black erode into gray as shown in C, and the gray line becomes It becomes thin. That is, due to the smoothing, the right side of the gray line moves to the left and the left side moves to the right.
