## SEEDS --The 7th Somatosensory Technology and International Exchange

2020/01/25

The theme of this "Mebae Dojo" is as follows. Light has both a wave property and a particle property. However, it applies not only to light, but also to electrons and substances that we consider to be "collections of particles", which have not only the properties of particles but also the properties of waves.

So why haven't we found "particles of light (child)" and "waves of electrons" in history?
